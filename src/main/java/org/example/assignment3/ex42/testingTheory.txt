The idea of ​​just selling well is on this floor
The same reason
I hate the sound of head-to-head rolling I wanted to wake up
Hey, this cramped rule
Damn I'm in the trap please let me out
I'm not your jewelry
I'm always trapped in the dark and I'm lost
(It has lost its light)
But in this dark and humid place, I'm burnin' star again
